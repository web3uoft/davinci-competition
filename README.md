### Section 1: GitHub Repository Requirements

- The GitHub repository should be set to public so that it can be accessed by judges and participants.
- The repository should contain all the necessary code, documentation, and resources related to the hackathon project.
- It is recommended to have a clear folder structure to organize the project files.
- The repository or READMe should clearly contain the link to the product.
- The repository should have a clear and concise README file (discussed in Section 2) that provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to set it up and run it.

### Section 2: GitHub READMe Requirements

Remember to keep your README file concise, well-organized, and easy to understand. Use headings, bullet points, and code formatting to improve readability. The README file is a crucial component of your GitHub repository. It serves as a comprehensive guide and documentation for your project, providing essential information for users, contributors, and potential collaborators. 

Here's a breakdown of what is expected within the README file:

1. Project Overview: Start with a concise introduction that explains the purpose and goals of your project. Provide a high-level overview of what the project aims to achieve and why it's important or interesting.
2. Installation Instructions: If your project requires any specific installation steps or dependencies, provide clear instructions on how to set up and run the project locally. Include all the necessary commands, configurations, or environment setup required to get started.
3. Usage Guide: Explain how to use your project. Provide instructions on how to navigate through your codebase, run the main functionalities, and interact with your project. If your project has a user interface, describe the different features and functionalities available.
4. Configuration: If your project has any configuration files or settings, explain how to modify them to customize the project's behaviour. Provide details on any environment variables, configuration flags, or files that users or contributors may need to adjust.
5. Documentation: If your project has extensive documentation beyond the README file, mention it here. Provide links or instructions on how users can access additional documentation, such as API references, user guides, or developer documentation.
6. Examples: If applicable, provide examples or code snippets that demonstrate how to use your project effectively. This can help users understand the capabilities of your project and quickly get started with implementing it in their own work.
7. Contribution Guidelines: If you want to encourage contributions from other developers, provide guidelines on how to contribute to your project. Explain the preferred process for submitting bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests. Specify any coding conventions, code review processes, or documentation standards to follow.
8. License: Include information about the project's license. Specify the license type (e.g., MIT, Apache, GNU) and provide a brief description of what it allows or restricts. If you're using an open-source license, you may include a license file in your repository as well.
9. Contact and Support: Provide contact information or links to resources where users or contributors can seek support or ask questions about your project. This can be an email address, a link to a support forum, or a dedicated issue tracker.
10. Project Status and Roadmap: You can mention the current status of the project, whether it's in active development, maintenance, or archived. If you have a roadmap or plan for future development, you can include it to give users an idea of upcoming features or improvements.
